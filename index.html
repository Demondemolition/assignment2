                <p>Visualisation by <b>Max Curtis</b> <br></br>The data displayed in this visualisation is extracted from the organization <b>Global Health Data Exchange (GHDx)</b>. Echoing their sentiments, suicide is a rampant disease that claims approximately <b>800,000 lives per year.</b> In 2017 (where the extracted data ends) saw 1.4% of deaths attributed to suicide. Understandably suicide numbers are often <b>underreported</b> due to its <b>taboo</b> nature. In fact, it is <b>criminalised</b> throughout most of Asia and Africa. Suicide <b>decriminalisation</b> remains a contentious issue. </p>

             <p>Why is <b>Age-Standardization</b> important? <br></br>
                Age-standardization is the process of <b>equalising</b> across all ages. This is important because <b>certain ages are more likely to commit suicide.</b> 
                For example, two country’s rate the same age specific mortality rate will have a higher suicide rate if that country has a greater proportion of the age demographic that is most susceptible to commit suicide. Standardizing across ages removes this affect. It allows for <b>direct comparison</b> between countries, even if they have different age-demographics. </p>

            <p>Issue with <b>Data Quality:</b> <br></br>
                The <b>taboo</b> nature of suicide means that suicide numbers are often not reported. Countries may choose to ignore the death or record it as an <b>accidental death</b> or under some other category (often undetermined cause). In countries like Australia and the USA the statistics are relatively reliable. However, suicide statistics are particularly unreliable in Asia and Africa. Here data often does not exist or is <b>misleading.</b> As such modelling techniques are used to predict in these areas.</p>
